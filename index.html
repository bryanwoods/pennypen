                <span class="gradient-text">Your security compliance costs should be a rounding error.</span>
            </h1>

            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                You need great security to protect your business. But as your security measures mature, you shouldn't
                need to worry about compliance costs growing out of control.
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                Today, most penetration testing services cost an arm and a leg. AI slop, expensive "expert"
                fees, and overpriced reports for vulnerabilities your own systems already catch. It's ridiculous.
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                And while your bills increase year over year, the value you get keeps diminishing. Most penetration
                testing services are redundant. They test the things you're already looking for, rehashing the
                OWASP Top 10 that your tools already help to avoid. Instead of tailored insights that enhance your
                security, you're stuck with cookie-cutter reports.
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed font-semibold">
                Take a look at your pen testing bill. How much are you paying every year just to check a box?
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                This isn't rocket science, and it shouldn't cost a fortune. We provide the same service at a fraction of
                the cost.
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                We want to provide your security team with the compliance artifacts they need, at a fraction of the
                cost. Our pricing is transparent and predictable, so you'll never be surprised, and
                you'll never be locked in.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
                For the next six months, we're offering a 50% discount compared to your current
                provider. Just send us your existing contract, and we'll immediately extend this cost savings to you.
            </h2>

            <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                Don't overpay for security theater. Choose smart, efficient compliance testing that respects your
                existing security measures and your budget.
